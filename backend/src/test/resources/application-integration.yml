spring:
  # The database in the docker container managed by testcontainers has a default of max_connections = 100.
  # Per default, Spring Test caches up to 32 test contexts, i.e. variations in ApplicationContexts for test classes (see
  # https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/testing.html#testcontext-ctx-management-caching).
  # There may be many test contexts and thus many db connection pools are created holding db connections warm for some
  # time (depending on spring.datasource.hikari.connectionTimeout). As long as a context is cached, its connection pool
  # and hence connections managed by the pool aren't released.
  # To stabilize tests, only use a single connection per test context.
  datasource.hikari:
    connectionTimeout: 10000
    maximumPoolSize: 1
